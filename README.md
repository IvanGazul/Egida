EGIDA is a lightweight, kernel-level HWID spoofer for Windows 10/11 x64 systems.  
Designed for educational and research purposes, EGIDA can spoof several hardware identifiers to bypass basic hardware bans and fingerprinting techniques.

## 🧪 How It Works

EGIDA operates by loading a kernel-mode driver that temporarily modifies values returned by key Windows management interfaces like `wmic`, `GetVolumeInformation`, `GetSystemFirmwareTable`, and others.

It hooks and patches kernel functions and modifies SMBIOS tables and disk device descriptors in memory.
